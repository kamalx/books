List all ebooks in current directory in an index.html file with filenames in the list as links to the files.


Instructions
------------
To build, do:
```$ python render.py```
in the current directory to index everything below the current depth.

Generated html will be saved as ```index.html```


Note:
-----
This is something I made to learn a little bit of Python, using Jinja2 templating engine standalone and meanwhile getting a nice static file generator system that works for me to list and display all my ebooks. It is by no means a production-ready software and you use it at your own risk.

Tempted to send a PR or fork it? You be most welcome! :D
